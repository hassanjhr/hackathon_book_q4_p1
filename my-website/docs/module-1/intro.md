# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

**Duration:** Weeks 3-5

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course!

## Overview

This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the foundation for modern robotics development. You'll learn the core concepts, tools, and workflows needed to build robotic systems.

Over three weeks, you'll progress from understanding ROS 2 architecture to building, packaging, and deploying complete robotic applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the ROS 2 architecture and ecosystem
- Set up a ROS 2 development environment
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages
- Work with nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Build basic robotic applications

## Weekly Roadmap

### Week 3: ROS 2 Architecture & Core Concepts

Learn the foundational building blocks of ROS 2:
- **ROS 2 Graph Architecture** - Understanding the middleware framework
- **Nodes** - Independent processes that perform specific tasks
- **Topics** - Asynchronous publish-subscribe communication
- **Services** - Synchronous request-response patterns
- **Actions** - Long-running tasks with feedback and cancellation
- **Python Examples** - Publisher, subscriber, service, and action implementations

### Week 4: Launch Files & Parameters

Master multi-node orchestration and runtime configuration:
- **Launch Files** - Starting entire robot systems with one command
- **Python vs XML** - Launch file formats and when to use each
- **Parameters** - Runtime configuration without code changes
- **YAML Configuration** - Managing complex parameter sets
- **Namespaces** - Running multiple robots without conflicts
- **Topic Remapping** - Connecting incompatible nodes

---

### Week 5: ROS 2 Packages & Best Practices

Build production-ready robotic systems:
- **Package Structure** - Organizing code for modularity and reuse
- **package.xml** - Declaring dependencies and metadata
- **setup.py** - Configuring Python packages and entry points
- **Building with colcon** - Workspace management and compilation
- **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, and launch tests
- **Best Practices** - Scalable, maintainable ROS 2 development

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you'll create a complete robot sensor package including:
- Multiple communicating nodes (sensors, processors, controllers)
- Configuration files for different scenarios
- Launch files for system orchestration
- Professional package structure
- Unit and integration tests

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python or C++)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of software development concepts

## Resources

- [ROS 2 Official Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/)
- [ROS 2 Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html)
- [ROS Answers Forum](https://answers.ros.org/)

## Next Steps

Once you complete this module, you'll be ready to move on to:
- **Module 2**: Digital Twin & Simulation
- **Module 3**: AI-Robot Brain Integration
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action Models

Let's get started with ROS 2!
