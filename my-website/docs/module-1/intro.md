# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course!

## Overview

This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the foundation for modern robotics development. You'll learn the core concepts, tools, and workflows needed to build robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the ROS 2 architecture and ecosystem
- Set up a ROS 2 development environment
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages
- Work with nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Build basic robotic applications

## Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to ROS 2
- What is ROS 2 and why it matters
- ROS 2 vs ROS 1: Key differences
- The ROS 2 ecosystem and community

### 2. ROS 2 Installation & Setup
- Installing ROS 2 Humble
- Setting up your workspace
- Understanding colcon build system

### 3. Core Concepts
- **Nodes**: The building blocks of ROS applications
- **Topics**: Publish-subscribe communication
- **Services**: Request-response patterns
- **Actions**: Long-running tasks with feedback
- **Parameters**: Runtime configuration

### 4. ROS 2 CLI Tools
- `ros2 run` - Running nodes
- `ros2 topic` - Inspecting topics
- `ros2 service` - Working with services
- `ros2 node` - Node management
- `ros2 bag` - Recording and playback

### 5. Creating Your First Package
- Package structure and conventions
- Writing publisher and subscriber nodes
- Launch files for multi-node systems
- Testing and debugging

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python or C++)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of software development concepts
