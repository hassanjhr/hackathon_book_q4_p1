# Module 0: Introduction to Physical AI

**Duration:** Weeks 1-2
**Focus:** Foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence

Welcome to the foundational module of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This module establishes the conceptual and technical groundwork for understanding how AI transitions from the digital realm into physical embodied systems.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll explore:

- **Foundations of Physical AI** - Understanding embodied intelligence and physical constraints
- **Digital AI vs Physical AI** - Key differences in architecture, constraints, and design
- **Physical Laws Awareness** - How robots must understand and operate within physical constraints
- **Humanoid Robotics Landscape** - Current state-of-the-art and future directions
- **Sensor Systems** - The robot's senses: LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, and force/torque sensors

## Why Physical AI Matters

Traditional AI operates in a purely digital environment where:
- Computation is deterministic
- Actions have no physical consequences
- There are no real-world constraints (gravity, friction, inertia)

Physical AI must bridge the gap between digital intelligence and physical reality:
- **Embodiment**: AI must control actuators and process sensor data
- **Real-time constraints**: Decisions must be made within milliseconds
- **Safety-critical**: Errors can cause physical damage or harm
- **Environmental uncertainty**: The real world is unpredictable and noisy
